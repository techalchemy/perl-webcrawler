WebCrawler:
Run from command line w/ ConfigFile location as param (configuration_files/testConfigFile.cfg)
Crawls links to depth n; for each page returning:
	1) PARSED_PAGE struct (actually a hashref) -> title, author, links, charset, keywords, description, bodytext

POSTDATA:
Expects to receive --
1) Function call to PostData::setConfigValues(CONFIGHASH REF);
2) Function call to PostData::sendToDB(UrgFlag, data1(struct/hash/array/scalar/ref*), data2......datan);

Needs ConfigHash with:
PostData_userAgent=agent
PostData_authName=username
PostData_userPass=Password
PostData_serverLocation=server

What it does:
Takes data of any type and converts it to JSON, serializes it, injects a random string at a random position, and HTTP POST's the data to the DBHANDLER

Format:
	Passed in HEADERS:
		UserAgent from config file (User_Agent)
		JSON sequential order of transfer start value bits (from array) (transportReplaceStart)
		JSON sequential order of injected string length (from array) (transportReplaceLen)
		Password salt value (passEncodeKey)
		Urgency Flag (urgencyFlag)
	
	Passed via HTTP POST to serverLocation from Config:
		Authenticating Username (authName)
		Encrypted password (userPass)
		pageURL
		JSON sequential order of randomized, serialized, JSON former data structures (dataPackage)
		
dbhandler.php

What it does:
authenticate: User_Agent from headers, passEncodeKey from headers, authName / userPass from form post
	After this, set authFlag to 1 (in returnArray)
Does authentication on the requesting client.  If the client is authenticated, then:
	1) Remove the random shit from the serialized data
	2) Look at urgency before passing info along
	3) Break info down for table // title, author, links, charset, keywords, description, bodytext
		a) Unserialize 
		b) Construct MYSQL query to post this info -- extract pageURL as key, values = title, author, keywords, charset, description, links, bodytext(blob?)
		c) Another MySQL query to keep track of linking (make 1 table per site?)
	4) return a serialized, encoded array of 1, 1 on success
